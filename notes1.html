  <h1> Things I learned </h1>
  <p>
   I learned about block and inline elements <br>
   Block elements make a box, inline elements happen within the given box. <br>
   Some block : 
  </p>
  <p> < p> < /p>  </p> 
  <p> < p> < /p>  </p> 
  <p> < p> < /p>  </p>
  
  <br>
 
  <div>< div>< /div></div>
  <div>< div>< /div></div>
  <div>< div>< /div></div>
  
  <br>
 
  Some inline <span>< span>< /span></span> or <b>< b>< /b></b> or 
  even the <img src="image.png" title="image" alt="image">. 
  <br> < br> is also an inline tag, although it shows on the next line


  <p>Tags can be void or have content. 
   <br> When they have content they keep it within the opening and the closing tags
   <br>< ***> : opening tag 
   <br>content : content 
   <br>< /***> : closing tag    
   <br>
   <br> Void tags come with one tag only. < img> or < br>. They finish within themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
   I learned also that html is a semantic language and this is why the < b> tag is not the best tag to indicate importance <br>
   the < strong> tag is to be used, the b proprieties are more to do with css. <br>
   The strong tag indicates what type of text it is, and not how it should be. Then html tells the browsers what type of text or data it is.
  </p>


  <p>and also i think that <<span></span>b< looks like a little shark!</p>
